## 🎯 Problem Statement

In rural areas, especially in regions like Odisha, timely access to healthcare is a significant challenge. This limitation adversely impacts the quality and effectiveness of medical interventions. The core issues include:

-   **Limited Access to Doctors:** A scarcity of qualified medical professionals in remote locations.
-   **Delayed Diagnosis:** Difficulty in getting timely preliminary diagnoses for common ailments.
-   **Lack of Awareness:** Insufficient knowledge about government health schemes and insurance.
-   **Geographical Barriers:** The distance and cost associated with traveling to urban centers for medical care.

Our project, "Apna Swasthya Saathi," aims to address these challenges by creating an accessible, AI-driven chatbot platform (voice and text-based) that interactively assesses basic health symptoms, categorizes potential health issues, generates detailed preliminary diagnostic reports, and provides referrals to qualified medical practitioners in nearby urban centers.

## ✨ Our Solution

**Apna Swasthya Saathi** (Our Health Companion) is a comprehensive ecosystem that bridges the gap between rural communities and healthcare services. Our platform empowers ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activist) workers and individuals with the tools to conduct initial health assessments, access government schemes, and receive timely medical guidance.

Our approach is a **B2G2C (Business-to-Government-to-Consumer)** model, where we partner with government bodies to deliver healthcare services directly to the citizens who need them most.
